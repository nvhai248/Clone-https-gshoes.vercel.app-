# TECHNICAL USED:
- `NodeJS` and `Ruby`: I use nodeJS for the back-end and embedded Ruby to support that. 
I use framework `express` and module `child_process`, 'ejs` to connect to `Ruby` file (in this case is `./views/index.rb` ). 
In `./views/index.rb`, I use `erb` to connect to `./views/index.html` and response to client interface. 
- `Jquery`, `CSS`, `HTML`, `Javascript`: support code UI/UX.
- `storageLocal` in `HTML5`:For save the added products to the cart.
